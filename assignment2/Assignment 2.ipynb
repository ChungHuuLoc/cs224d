    "## Role of placeholder\n",
    "\n",
    "The placeholder allows you to feed data into the computation graph by way of feed dictionaries. This gives you an entry point from your non-TensorFlow code in Python so you can run a graph on new inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow's automatic differentiation obviates the need for explicit gradient definition because it decomposes the graph into distinct `Op` components, each of which it has defined the gradient for. It then applies the chain rule to the graph, computes all relevant gradients, and runs a special training `Op` apply updates to the affected `Tensor` components."
